# CCR TSV TEST DATA	
# Rep Order Date and Magistrates Court for CCR claim	
# Intended to be read using ????.py 
#	
# GENERAL INFO
# When read using ????.py
# - Blank rows or rows starting with # are skipped	
# - First unskipped row is read as headings (dictionary keys)
# - If headings not yet read, lines containing only spaces will also be skipped 
#   (safety measure as difficult to distinguish by eye from blank row)
# - Subsequent unskipped rows are read as data (dictionary values).
# - Lines with just spaces are still read as data (unlike headings).	
# - Headings with no data at all are ignored (but only a single value in any row is sufficient for inclusion)
# - Data with no heading are also ignored (i.e. maximum number of items per row is set by the number of headings in the headings row).
